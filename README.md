The app fetches weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). To use this app, you will need to sign up for your personal API key from WeatherAPI and add it to the application's configuration.

## Configuration

Before running the app, you need to set up your environment with your personal API key from WeatherAPI. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key. Note that the key should not be pushed to public repositories for security reasons.

```javascript

```
